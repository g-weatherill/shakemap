<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This ShakeMap Technical Guide is meant as the definitive source of information
pertaining to the generation of ShakeMaps.  Many of the initial descriptions in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999a"><span>Wald et al.
(1999a)</span></a> are outdated and are superseded by this current report.  Technical users of
ShakeMap should also consult the <a class="reference internal" href="users_guide.html#users-guide"><span>User&#8217;s Guide</span></a> for additional information
pertaining to the format and range of available ShakeMap products.</p>
<p>Throughout this document, all parameters are italicized; specific parameters that can be configured within the
ShakeMap software are indicated in parentheses.  These configurable
parameters are further described in the ShakeMap <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="shakemap-software-overview">
<h2>ShakeMap Software Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-software-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>ShakeMap is a collection of modules written in PERL and C.  PERL is a powerful, freely
available scripting language that runs on all computer platforms.  The collection of PERL
modules allows the processing to flow in discrete steps that can be run collectively or
individually.  Within the PERL scripts, other software packages are called, specifically
packages that enable the graphics and much of the heavy grid-based computation.  For
instance, maps are made using the Generic Mapping Tool (GMT; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#gmt-ref"><span>Wessel and Smith,
1991)</span></a>, and the Postscript output from GMT is converted to JPEG format using
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">ImageMagick</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/">GraphicsMagick</a>.  In the design of ShakeMap,
all components are built
from freely available, open-source packages.</p>
<p>While the PERL language is not the fastest possible way to implement ShakeMap, we
note that much of the heavy computational load is handled by highly optimized programs
(usually written in C) that are called from within the PERL programs. Even for networks
with hundreds of stations over large regions, ShakeMap takes only a minute or so to run
on a modern computer (and much of that time is spent in product generation, e.g.,
converting PostScript images to JPEG&#8212;something that would be very difficult to
optimize further).</p>
<p>To enable customization for specific earthquakes or for different regions, each ShakeMap
module has an accompanying collection of configuration files.  For example, in these
files, one assigns the regional geographic boundaries and mapping characteristics to be
used by GMT, which ground motion prediction equation (GMPE) to use, where and how
to transfer the maps, email recipient lists, and so on.  Specific details about the software
and configuration files are described in detail in the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>.</p>
<p>With standardization in GIS and web application interfaces (API), several aspects of the
ShakeMap system could be accomplished within GIS applications, but the open-source,
freely available nature of GMT combined with PERL scripting tools allows for a flexible
and readily available ShakeMap software package.  Nonetheless, we do generate a
number of GIS product formats for that widespread user group as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="users_guide.html#users-guide"><span>User&#8217;s Guide</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="philosophy-of-estimating-and-interpolating-ground-motions">
<h2>Philosophy of Estimating and Interpolating Ground Motions<a class="headerlink" href="#philosophy-of-estimating-and-interpolating-ground-motions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The overall strategy for the deployment of stations under the ANSS implementation plan
relies on dense instrumentation concentrated in urban areas with high seismic hazards
(<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#usgs1999"><span>USGS, 1999</span></a>) and fewer stations in outlying areas.  Based on this philosophy, and when
fully deployed, maps generated in these urban regions are expected to be most accurate
where the population at risk is the greatest, and therefore, where emergency response and
recovery efforts will likely be most urgent and complex.</p>
<p>Even so, significant gaps in the observed shaking distribution will likely remain,
especially in the transition from urban to more rural environments. Likewise, many
critical facilities and lifelines are widely distributed, away from population centers and
their dense seismic sensor networks.  Thus, as a fundamental strategy for ShakeMap, we
have developed algorithms to best describe the shaking in more remote areas by utilizing
a variety of seismological tools.  In addition to the areas without sufficient
instrumentation where we would like to estimate motions to help assess the situation, and
as a fail-safe backup, it is also useful to have these algorithms in place in
the event of potential communication dropout from a portion of the network.  The same
tools are, in fact, beneficial for interpolating between observations (i.e., seismic stations) even
within densely instrumented portions of the networks.</p>
<p>If there were stations at each of the tens of thousands of map grid points needed to
adequately portray shaking, then the creation of shaking maps would be relatively simple.
Of course, stations are not available for all of these grid points, and in many cases grid
points may be tens of kilometers from the nearest reporting station.  The overall mapping
philosophy is then to combine information from individual stations, site amplification
characteristics, and ground-motion prediction equations for the distance to the hypocenter
(or to the causative fault) to create the best composite map.  The procedure should
produce reasonable estimates at grid points located far from available data while
preserving the detailed shaking information available for regions where there are stations
nearby.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that mathematically, or algorithmically, geospatial interpolation
can take many forms. There are some good reasons to employ geospatial kriging-with-a-trend).
However, the complexity of the trends (GMPE, as well as inter-event bias
corrections per Intensity Measure or IM), the use of multiply-weighted strong-motion and macroseimic
data, and the real-time nature of the processing require other considerations. Effectively,
the approach ShakeMap currently employs for interpolation (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2010"><span>Worden et al., 2010</span></a>), which
employs a predetermined spatial correlation function, approaches <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging">kriging-with-a-trend</a>
mathematically. We address this possibility further in <a class="reference internal" href="future_directions.html#future-directions"><span>Future Directions</span></a>.</p>
<p>Estimating motions where there are few stations, and then interpolating the recordings and
estimates to a fine grid for mapping and contouring, requires several steps. In the
following sections, we describe the process from input to final interpolated grid. Where
beneficial, we illustrate the effects of key steps with example ShakeMap figures.</p>

<div class="section" id="recorded-ground-motion-parameters">
<h2>Recorded Ground-motion Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#recorded-ground-motion-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="data-acquisition">
<h3>Data Acquisition<a class="headerlink" href="#data-acquisition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ShakeMap requires estimates of magnitude, location, and (optionally, but preferably)
shaking IMs at seismic stations. As such, ShakeMap has been interfaced with
several types of seismic processing systems in wide use at numerous networks across the U.S. and
around the world, including Antelope, SeisComP 3, and AQMS. The ShakeMap system,
however, is a stand-alone software package and is really a passive consumer of seismic
data. In other words, the ShakeMap software itself contains no data acquisition component. It is
assumed that ShakeMap earthquake source information and parametric data are packaged
for delivery to ShakeMap and that that delivery will trigger a ShakeMap run. The
required format is in XML, as fully described in the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>.
Some programs are provided to convert ASCII text and other formats to the required input
XML.
It is assumed that station data delivered to ShakeMap are free-field sites that have been
vetted by the contributing network. Each station must have stand-alone metadata
describing its station location, contributing network, channel, and location code. While some
additional outlier and data quality checks are performed within ShakeMap (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-shakemap-processing"><span>ShakeMap Processing</span></a>), it is assumed that this is primarily the
responsibility of the contributing seismic network.</p>
<p>For global and historic earthquake ShakeMap generation, we have developed scripts to
preprocess various forms of seismic waveform (as well as macroseismic) data which are
openly available around the world. For example, we provide a Python script <em>getstrong</em>
run independently of ShakeMap, as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>For illustrative purposes, we describe the data acquisition for the seismic system in
Southern California, a component of the California Integrated Seismic Network (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cisn.org">CISN</a>).
For perspective, as of 2015, there were nearly 800 real-time stations jointly operated with
a collaboration between the USGS and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). In addition, the California Geological Survey (CGS)
contributes nearly 350 strong-motion stations in near real-time, utilizing an automated
telephone dial-up procedure (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#shakal1998"><span>Shakal et al, 1998</span></a>), and the USGS National Strong Motion
Instrumentation Program (NSMP) contributes dial-up station parameters as well, with
nearly 50 stations in Southern California alone.  Lastly, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/map">&#8220;NetQuakes&#8221;</a> program, a
relatively low-cost seismograph that the USGS installs in homes, businesses, buildings, and
schools, contributes close to 100 additional stations in Southern California.</p>
<p>Generation of ShakeMap in Southern California is automatic, triggered by the event
associator of the seismic network.  Within the first two minutes of an earthquake, ground-
motion parameters are available from the USGS-Caltech component of the network, and
within several minutes most of the important near-source CGS and NSMP stations contribute; a
more complete CGS and NSMP contribution is available within approximately
ten minutes of an event.  Initial maps are made with the real-time component of CISN as
well as any of the available dial-sites, and they are updated automatically as more data
are acquired.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="derived-parametric-ground-motion-values">
<h3>Derived Parametric Ground-motion Values<a class="headerlink" href="#derived-parametric-ground-motion-values" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parametric data from stations serving ShakeMap should include peak ground acceleration
(PGA), peak ground velocity (PGV), and peak response spectral acceleration amplitudes
(at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec).  Often, parametric values are derived continuously, using
recursive time-domain filtering as described by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#kanamori1999"><span>Kanamori et al. (1999)</span></a>.  Otherwise
parameters are derived from post-processing as described by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#shakal1998"><span>Shakal et al. (1998)</span></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#converse1992"><span>Converse and Brady (1992)</span></a>.</p>
<p>ShakeMap will run successfully with no (or limited) parametric data, for example if only
PGA values are available at each station. Default logic is employed to provide reasonable
behavior for estimating intensities from PGA alone, bias correction, and interpolation
(see following sections). Likewise, for smaller-magnitude earthquakes, spectral values
can be noisy, so operators often omit the generation spectral maps below a lower
magnitude threshold (about M4); this can be done with simple command-line options.</p>
<p>For all maps and products, the motions depicted are peak values as observed; that is, the
maximum value observed on the two horizontal components of motion.  Many engineers
are used to analyses employing the geometric mean of the horizontal peak-ground
motions, but that is not done for ShakeMap. More description and justification for this
strategy is given in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#peak-values-vs-mean"><span>Use of Peak Values Rather than Mean</span></a>. It should be noted, however, that conversions from peak
to geometric mean (or other measures) are available (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#beyer2006"><span>Beyer and Bommer, 2006</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macroseismic-intensity">
<h3>Macroseismic Intensity<a class="headerlink" href="#macroseismic-intensity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ShakeMap also (optionally) accepts input data in the form of observed macroseismic
intensity (MMI, MCS, etc.). As with peak ground motion parameters from seismic
stations, ShakeMap expects specific file formats (XML) and site metadata for
macroseismic data (see the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>).</p>
<p>Intensity data can fill important gaps where ground-motion recordings are not available,
and often provide the only control in sparsely instrumented areas. This is particularly true
for historic earthquakes, for which macroseismic data provide important constraints on
shaking intensities. As later discussed, the ShakeMap Atlas (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2008"><span>Allen et al., 2008</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2009a"><span>2009a</span></a>;
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#garcia2012a"><span>Garcia et al., 2012a</span></a>) is a collection of important historic earthquake shaking maps which
are now widely used for scientific analyses and for loss model calibration (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2008"><span>Wald et
al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jaiswal2010"><span>Jaiswal and Wald, 2010</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#pomonis2011"><span>Pomonis and So, 2011)</span></a>.</p>
<p>The most common source for immediate post-earthquake intensity data is the USGS&#8217;s
“Did You Feel It?” (DYFI) system (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2011c"><span>Wald et al., 2011</span></a>), though similar systems are
available in several countries. However, traditionally assigned intensities may be used as
well. DYFI data can be programmatically retrieved from the USGS&#8217;s database and
formatted for ShakeMap input using the ShakeMap program <em>getdyfi</em>, making it
especially easy to incorporate into the ShakeMap data input stream.</p>
<p>Macroseismic intensity data can also be an important constraint on peak ground motions,
since ground motion amplitudes can be derived from intensity through the use of a suitable Ground-Motion/Intensity
Conversion Equation (GMICE). Because a GMICE represents a statistical (probabilistic)
relationship, the conversion to and from intensity has a higher uncertainty than direct
ground-motion observation. ShakeMap accounts for this higher uncertainty by down-
weighting converted observations in the interpolation process, as discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-interpolation"><span>Interpolation</span></a> section.</p>
<p>A variety of GMICEs are available with the ShakeMap software distribution, both for
MMI&#8212;based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999b"><span>Wald, et al. (1999b)</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden, et al. (2012)</span></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#atkinson2007"><span>Atkinson and Kaka (2007)</span></a>, among others&#8212;and for MCS&#8212;based on <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#faenza2010"><span>Faenza and Michilini (2010)</span></a>. Operators are
encouraged to explore the need to develop their own relationships based on data covering
their own operational area as GMICEs have been shown to have regional dependencies
(e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#caprio2015"><span>Caprio et al., 2015</span></a>). A complete list of GMICEs currently employed by ShakeMap is
provided in the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>.</p>
<p>We have implemented a convention for maps and regression plots that seismic stations
are represented with triangles and macroseismic data are depicted with circles (see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-1">Figure  1</a>, for example). This convention is forward-looking: not all seismic networks were
currently following this convention at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>In areas distant from the control of seismic instrumentation or reported intensity, ground
motions must be estimated using the available earthquake source parameters and GMPEs
or Intensity Prediction Equations (IPEs). GMPEs are available for a wide range of magnitudes, source mechanisms,
and tectonic settings. IPEs are still comparatively uncommon, with only a handful of
published relations, focused on active tectonic and stable shield (cratonic) environments
(e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#atkinson-wald2007"><span>Atkinson and Wald, 2007</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2012"><span>Allen et al., 2012</span></a>). To supplement the available IPEs, we
have developed a &#8220;virtual IPE&#8221; which is a combination of the operator&#8217;s selected GMPE
and Ground Motion/Intensity Conversion Equation (GMICE), which work together to
present the same interface and behaviors as a direct IPE, while being available for a
wider range of regional and tectonic environments.</p>
<p>We describe the way ShakeMap employs ground-motion and intensity predictions in
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-shakemap-processing"><span>ShakeMap Processing</span></a>. An up-to-date list of the GMPEs and IPEs available for ShakeMap can be

<p>As discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="users_guide.html#users-guide"><span>User&#8217;s Guide</span></a>, ShakeMap produces a range of output products.
However, ShakeMap&#8217;s primary outputs are grids of interpolated ground motions, from
which the other grids, contours, and maps are derived. Interpolated grids are produced for
PGA, PGV, macroseismic intensity (we will hereafter refer to macroseismic intensity
as &#8220;MMI&#8221; for Modified Mercalli Intensity, but other intensity measures are supported),
and (optionally) pseudo-spectral accelerations at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec. Attendant grids of
shaking-parameter uncertainty and Vs30, are also produced as separate
products or for later analyses of each intermediate processing step, if so desired.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap program responsible for producing the interpolated grids is called
&#8220;<em>grind</em>”.  This section is a description of the way <em>grind</em> works, and some of the
configuration parameters and command-line flags that control specific functionality. (For

<p>The sections that follow provide a more complete description of the processing steps outlined
above.</p>
<div class="section" id="data-preparation">
<h3>Data preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step in processing is the preparation of the parametric data. As discussed in the
<a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>, ground motion amplitudes are provided to ShakeMap in the form of
Extended Markup Language (XML) files. Note that we describe here the behavior of
<em>grind</em> with respect to the input XML file(s). The programs that produce the input XML
(be it <em>db2xml</em>, others, or the network operator&#8217;s custom codes) will have their own rules
as to what is included in the input.</p>
<p>In our presentation here, the term “station” refers to a single seismographic station
denoted with a station ID (i.e., a code or number). In current practice, station IDs often
consist of a network identifier concatenated (using a “.”) with the station ID (e.g.,
“CI.JVC” or “CE.50281”).</p>
<p>Each station may have one or more “channels,” each of which is denoted by an ID code
(often called a “seedchan”). The last character of the ID is assumed to be the orientation
of the instrument (east-west, north-south, vertical). ShakeMap only
uses the peak horizontal component. Thus, ShakeMap does not consider amplitudes with a “Z” as the
final character, though it does carry the vertical amplitude
values through to the output station files. Note that some
stations in some networks are given orientations of “1”, “2”, and “3” (rather than the more
standard “N”, “E”, and “Z”), where any of the components may be vertical. Because of the
non-standardized nature of these component labels, ShakeMap does not attempt to
discern their orientation and assumes that they are all horizontal. This can lead to inaccuracies&#8212;it becomes the network operator&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that the vertical channel
is either excluded or labeled with a “Z” before the data are presented to ShakeMap.
Similarly, many networks co-locate broadband instruments with strong-motion
instruments and produce PGMs for both. Again, it is the network operator&#8217;s responsibility
to select the instrument that best represents the data for the PGMs in question. Aside from
the station flagging discussed below, ShakeMap makes no attempt to discern which of a
set of components is superior, it will simply use the largest value it finds (i.e., if
ShakeMap sees channels “HNE” and “HHE” for the same station, it will simply use the
larger of the two PGMS without regard to the possibility that one may be off-scale or
below-noise).</p>
<p>Currently, ShakeMap is location-code agnostic. Because the current SNCL (Station,
Network, Channel, Location) specification defines the location code as a pure identifier
(i.e., it should have no meaning), it is impossible to anticipate all the ways it may be used.
Therefore, if a network-station combo has multiple instruments at multiple locations, the
data provider should identify each location as a distinct station for ShakeMap XML input
purposes (by, for example, including the location code as part of the station identifier,
N.S.L&#8212;e.g., &#8216;CI.JVC.01&#8217;). If the network uses the location codes in another manner, it is
up to the operator to generate a station/component data structure that ShakeMap will
handle correctly.</p>
<p>Finally, each channel may produce one or more amplitudes (e.g., PGA, PGV, pseudo-
spectral acceleration). Note that these amplitudes should always be supplied by the
network as positive values, regardless of the direction of the peak motion. The amplitudes
for all stations and channels are collected and reported, but only the peak horizontal
amplitude of each ground-motion parameter is used by ShakeMap.</p>
<p>The foregoing is not intended to be a complete description of the requirements for the
input data. Please see the relevant section of the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>
for complete information.</p>
<div class="section" id="flagged-stations">
<h4>Flagged Stations<a class="headerlink" href="#flagged-stations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If the “flag” attribute of any amplitude in the input XML is non-null and non-zero, then
all components of that station are flagged as unusable. The reasoning here is that for a
given data stream, the typical network errors (telemetry glitch, incomplete data, off-scale
or below-noise data, etc.) will affect all of the parameters (as they are typically all
derived from the same data stream), and it is therefore impossible to determine the peak
horizontal component of any ground-motion parameter. This restriction is not without its
detractors, however, and we may revisit it at a future date.</p>
<p>MMI data are treated in much the same way; however, there is typically only one
&#8220;channel&#8221; and one parameter (i.e., intensity).</p>
<p>ShakeMap presents flagged stations as
open, unfilled triangles on maps and on regression plots. In contrast, unflagged stations
are color coded by network or, optionally, by their amplitudes via their converted intensity
value, as shown in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-2">Figure  4</a>. Flagged stations are also indicated as such within tables
produced for ShakeMap webpage consumption, e.g., the <em>stations.xml</em> file.</p>

<h4>Converting MMI to PGM and PGM to MMI<a class="headerlink" href="#converting-mmi-to-pgm-and-pgm-to-mmi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once the input data have been read and peak amplitudes assigned for each station (which
may be null if the data are flagged), intensities are derived from the peak
amplitudes and peak amplitudes are derived from the intensities using the GMICEs
configured (see the parameters &#8216;pgm2mi&#8217; and &#8216;mi2pgm&#8217; in <em>grind.conf</em>). Small values of
observed intensities (MMI &lt; III for PGA, and MMI &lt; IV for other parameters) are not
converted to PGM for inclusion in the PGM maps. Our testing indicated that including
these low intensities introduced a significant source of error in the interpolation, likely
due to the very wide range (and overlap) of ground motions that can produce MMIs lower than III or IV.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="site-corrections">
<h4>Site Corrections<a class="headerlink" href="#site-corrections" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Near-surface conditions can have a substantial effect on ground motions. Ground motions
at soft-soil sites, for instance, will typically be amplified relative to sites on bedrock.
Because we wish to interpolate sparse data to a grid over which site characteristics may
vary greatly, we first remove the effects of near-surface amplification from our data,
perform the interpolation to a uniform grid at bedrock conditions, and then apply the site
amplifications to each point in the grid, based on each site&#8217;s characteristics.</p>
<p>A commonly used proxy used to account for site effects (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#borcherdt1994"><span>Borcherdt, 1994</span></a>) is Vs30,
the time-averaged shear wave velocity to 30 meters depth. Vs30 is also a fundamental
explanatory variable for modern GMPEs (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#abrahamson2014"><span>Abrahamson et al., 2014</span></a>).  Since the use
of GMPEs for ground motion estimation is fundamental to ShakeMap, we follow this
convention and use Vs30-based amplification terms to account for site amplification.
In <a class="reference internal" href="future_directions.html#future-directions"><span>Future Directions</span></a>, we suggest alternative approaches that require additional
site information beyond Vs30.</p>
<div class="section" id="site-characterization-map">
<h5>Site Characterization Map<a class="headerlink" href="#site-characterization-map" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Each region wishing to implement ShakeMap should have a Vs30 map that covers the
entire area they wish to map.  Using the Jan. 17, 1994, M6.7 Northridge, California
earthquake ShakeMap as an example (<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-4">Figure  5</a>), we present,
in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-5">Figure  6</a>, the Vs30 map used.
Until 2015, the California site-condition map was based on geologic base maps as
introduced by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wills2000"><span>Wills et al. (2000)</span></a>, and modified by Howard Bundock and Linda Seekins
of the USGS at Menlo Park (H. Bundock, written comm., 2002). The Wills et
al. map extent is
that of the State boundary; however, ShakeMap requires a rectangular grid, so fixed
velocity regions were inserted to fill the grid areas representing the ocean and land
outside of California. Unique values were chosen to make it easy to replace those values
in the future. The southern boundary of the Wills et al. map coincides with the U.S.A./Mexico
border.  However, due to the abundant seismic activity in Imperial Valley and northern
Mexico, we have continued the trend of the Imperial Valley and Peninsular Ranges south
of the border by approximating the geology based on the topography; classification BC
was assigned to sites above 100m in elevation and CD was assigned to those below 100m.
This results in continuity of our site correction across the international border.</p>

<p>Other ShakeMap operators have employed existing geotechnically- or geologically-based
Vs30 maps, or have developed their own Vs30 map for the area covered by their
ShakeMap. For regions lacking such maps, including most of globe, operators often
employ the approach of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald2007"><span>Wald and Allen (2007)</span></a>, revised by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#allen2009b"><span>Allen and Wald, (2009b)</span></a>,
which provides estimates of Vs30 as a function of more readily available topographic
slope data. Wald and Allen&#8217;s slope-based Vs30-mapping proxy is employed by the Global
ShakeMap (GSM) system.</p>

basis for refining Vs30 maps when Vs30 data constraints are abundant. Their method
employs not only geologic units and topographic slope, but also explicitly constrains map
values near Vs30 observations using kriging-with-a-trend to introduce the level of spatial
variations seen in the Vs30 data (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#thompson2014"><span>Thompson et al., 2014</span></a>).  An example of Vs30 for

<div class="section" id="amplification-factors">
<h5>Amplification Factors<a class="headerlink" href="#amplification-factors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>ShakeMap provides two operator-selectable methods for determining the factors used to
amplify and de-amplify ground motions based on Vs30. The first is to apply the
frequency- and amplitude-dependent factors, such as those determined by
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#borcherdt1994"><span>Borcherdt (1994)</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#seyhan2014"><span>Seyhan and Stewart (2014)</span></a>.
By default, amplification of PGA employs Borcherdt&#8217;s short-period factors; PGV uses mid-period
factors; and PSA at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec uses the short-, mid-, and long-period factors,
respectively. The second method uses the site correction terms supplied with the user&#8217;s
chosen GMPE (if such terms are supplied for that GMPE). The differences between these
choices and their behavior with respect to other user-configurable parameters are
discussed in the <a class="reference internal" href="software_guide.html#software-guide"><span>Software &amp; Implementation Guide</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="correct-data-to-rock">
<h5>Correct Data to &#8220;Rock&#8221;<a class="headerlink" href="#correct-data-to-rock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If, as is usually the case, the operator has opted to apply site amplification (via the <em>-qtm</em>
option to <em>grind</em>), the ground-motion observations are corrected (de-amplified) to &#8220;rock”.
(The Vs30 of &#8220;rock&#8221; is specified with the parameter &#8216;smVs30default&#8217; in <em>grind.conf</em>.) See
the section &#8220;Site Corrections&#8221; in the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a> for
a complete discussion of the way
site amplifications are handled and the options for doing so.</p>
<p>Note that Borcherdt-style corrections do not handle PGV directly, so PGV is converted to
1.0 sec PSA (using <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#newmark1982"><span>Newmark and Hall, 1982)</span></a>, (de)amplified using the mid-period
Borcherdt terms, and then converted back to PGV. The Newmark and Hall conversion is
entirely linear and reversible, so while the conversion itself is an approximation, no bias
or uncertainty remains from the conversion following a &#8220;round trip&#8221; from site to bedrock
back to site.</p>
<p>Because there are no well-established site correction terms for MMI, when Borcherdt-
style corrections are specified, ShakeMap converts MMI to PGM, applies the
(de)amplification to PGM using the Borcherdt terms, then converts the PGMs back to
MMI.</p>
<p><a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  8</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  9</a> show shaking estimates before site
correction (upper left) and after
(upper right). Without site correction, ground
motion attenuation is uniform as a function of hypocentral distance; with site correction,
the correlation of amplitudes with the Vs30 map (and also topography) are more
apparent. This distinction is important: often complexity in ShakeMap&#8217;s peak ground
motions and intensity patterns are driven by site terms, rather than variability due to
shaking observations.</p>

<p>As the final step in correcting the observations to &#8220;rock,&#8221; if basin amplification is
specified (with the <em>-basement</em> flag), the basin amplifications are removed from the PGM
data. Currently, basin amplifications are not applied to MMI.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="event-bias">
<span id="sec-event-bias"></span><h3>Event Bias<a class="headerlink" href="#event-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ShakeMap uses ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and, optionally, intensity prediction
equations (IPEs) to supplement sparse data in its interpolation and estimation of ground
motions. If sufficient data are available, we compute an event bias that effectively
removes the inter-event uncertainty from the selected GMPE (IPE). This approach has
been shown to greatly improve the quality of the ShakeMap ground motion estimates (for
details, see <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden et al., 2012</span></a>).</p>
<p>The bias-correction procedure is relatively straightforward: the magnitude of the
earthquake is adjusted so as to minimize the misfit between the observational data and
estimates at the observation points produced by the GMPE. If the user has chosen to use
the directivity correction (with the <em>-directivity</em> flag), directivity is applied to the
estimates.</p>
<p>In computing the total misfit, primary observations are weighted as if they were GMPE
predictions, whereas converted observations are down-weighted by treating them as if
they were GMPE predictions converted using the GMICE (i.e., primary observations are
given full weighting, whereas the converted observations are given a substantially lower
weight.) Once a bias has been obtained, we flag (as outliers) any data that exceed a user-
specified threshold (often three times the nominal sigma of the GMPE). The bias is then
recalculated and the flagging is repeated until no outliers are found. The flagged outliers
are then excluded from further processing (though the operator can choose to modify the
outlier criteria or impose their inclusion).</p>
<p>(There are a number of configuration parameters that affect the bias computation and the
flagging of outliers&#8212;see the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a> and <em>grind.conf</em>
for a complete discussion of these parameters.)</p>
<p>The biased GMPE is then used to create estimates for the entire output grid.  If the user
has opted to include directivity effects, they are applied to these
estimates. See the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-interpolation"><span>Interpolation</span></a> section for the way the GMPE-based estimates are used.</p>
<p>The Northridge earthquake ShakeMap provides an excellent example of the effect
of bias correction. Overall, the ground motions for the Northridge earthquake exceed
average estimates of existing GMPEs&#8212;in other words, it has a significant positive
inter-event bias term (see <a class="pageref" href="#nr-pga-regr">Figure  10</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#nr-pgv-regr">Figure  11</a>).</p>

<span id="sec-interpolation"></span><h3>Interpolation<a class="headerlink" href="#interpolation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The interpolation procedure is described in detail in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden et al. (2010)</span></a>. Here we
summarize it only briefly.</p>
<p>To compute an estimate of ground motion at a given point in the latitude-longitude grid,
ShakeMap finds an uncertainty-weighted average of 1) direct observations of ground
motion or intensity, 2) direct observations of one type converted to another type (i.e.,
PGM converted to MMI, or vice versa), and 3) estimates from a GMPE or IPE. Note that
because the output grid points are some distance from the observations, we use a spatial
correlation function to obtain an uncertainty for each observation when evaluated at the
outpoint point. The total uncertainty at each point is a function of the uncertainty of the
direct observations obtained with the distance-to-observation uncertainty derived from
the spatial correlation function, and that of the GMPE or IPE.</p>
<p>In the case of direct ground-motion observations, the uncertainty at the observation site is
assumed to be zero, whereas at the &#8220;site&#8221; of a direct intensity observation, it is assumed to
have a non-zero uncertainty due to the spatially averaged nature of intensity assignments.
The uncertainty for estimates from
GMPEs (and IPEs) is the stated uncertainty given in the generative publication or
document. The GMPE uncertainty is often spatially constant, but this is not always the
case, especially with more recent GMPEs.</p>
<p>For converted observations, a third uncertainty is combined with zero-distance
uncertainty and the uncertainty due to spatial separation: the uncertainty associated with
the conversion itself (i.e., the uncertainty of the GMICE). This additional uncertainty
results in the converted observations being down-weighted in the average, relative to the
primary observations.</p>
<p>Because a point in the output may be closer to or farther from the source than a nearby
contributing observation, the observation is scaled by the ratio of the GMPE (or IPE)
estimates at the output point and the observation point:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/3c203424896763e81921c0c9f19510915c4fd75c.png" alt="Y_{obs,xy} = Y_{obs} \times \left(\frac{Y_{\text{GMPE},xy}}{Y_{\text{GMPE},obs}}\right),         (1)"/></p>

at the observation point and the point (<em>x</em>,*y*), respectively. This scaling is also applied to
the converted observations with the obvious substitutions. Note that the application of
this term also accounts for any geometric terms (such as directivity or source geometry)
that the ground-motion estimates may include.</p>
<p>The formula for the estimated ground motion at a point (<em>x</em>,*y*) is then given by:</p>

with converted observation <em>j</em> at the point (<em>x</em>,*y*).</p>

reciprocal of the denominator of Equation 2 is the total variance at each point&#8212;a useful

</div>
<div class="section" id="differences-in-handling-mmi">
<h3>Differences in Handling MMI<a class="headerlink" href="#differences-in-handling-mmi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The processing of MMI is designed to be identical to the processing of PGM; however, a
few differences remain:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>As of this writing, there are no spatial correlation functions available for MMI.
We are working on developing one, but it is not complete. We currently use the
spatial correlation function for PGA as a proxy for MMI, though this approach is
not particularly satisfying.</li>
<li>Because there are relatively few IPEs available at this time, we have introduced
the idea of a virtual IPE (VIPE). If the user does not specify an IPE in <em>grind.conf</em>,
<em>grind</em> will use the configured GMPE in combination with the GMICE to simulate
the functionality of an IPE. In particular, the bias is computed as a magnitude
adjustment to the VIPE to produce the best fit to the intensity observations (and
converted observations) as described in <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-event-bias"><span>Event Bias</span></a>; and the
uncertainty of the VIPE is the combined uncertainty of the GMPE and the
GMICE.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, intensity observations are given an inherent uncertainty
because of the nature of their assignment. Our research has shown that this
uncertainty amounts to a few tenths of an intensity unit, but it varies with the
number of responses within the averaged area. Research in this area is incomplete,
and intensity data can contain both &#8220;Did You Feel It?&#8221; data and traditionally
assigned intensities. Because of these considerations, we currently use a
conservative value of 0.5 intensity units for the inherent uncertainty.</li>
<li>The directivity function we use (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel, 2010</span></a>) does not have terms for
intensity. This is not a problem when using the VIPE, since we can apply the
directivity function to the output of the encapsulated GMPE before converting to
intensity. But when a true IPE is used, we instantiate the VIPE and
compute two intensity grids: one with and one without directivity activated. We
then subtract the former from the latter and add the results to the output of the
IPE. We use the same procedure when creating estimates at observation locations
for computing the bias.</li>
<li>As mentioned above, we currently have no function for applying basin
amplification to the intensity data. We hope to remedy this shortly with a solution
similar to item 4, above, where we apply the basin effects through a
VIPE. In practice, the main areas where basin depth models are
available are also those within which station density is great
(e.g., Los Angeles and San Francisco, California).</li>

<h3>Fault Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#fault-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Small-to-moderate earthquakes can be effectively characterized as a point source, with
distances being calculated from the hypocenter (or epicenter, depending on the GMPE).
But accurate prediction of ground motions from larger earthquakes requires knowledge of
the fault geometry. This is because ground motions attenuate with
distance from the source (i.e. fault), but for a spatially extended source, that distance can be quite different
from the distance to the hypocenter. Most GMPEs are developed using earthquakes with
well-constrained fault geometry, and therefore are not suitable for prediction of ground
motions from large earthquakes when only a point source is available. As discussed in the
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-median-distance"><span>next section</span></a>, we handle this common situation by using terms that modify the
distance calculation to accommodate the unknown fault geometry. We also allow the
operator to specify a finite fault, as discussed in sections <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-fault-dimensions"><span>Fault Dimensions</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-directivity"><span>Directivity</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="median-distance-and-finite-faults">
<span id="sec-median-distance"></span><h4>Median Distance and Finite Faults<a class="headerlink" href="#median-distance-and-finite-faults" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As discussed in the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>, the user may specify a
finite fault to guide the
estimates of the GMPE, but often a fault model is not available for some time following
an earthquake. For larger events, this becomes problematic because the
distance-to-source
term ShakeMap provides to the GMPE in order to predict ground motions comes
from the hypocenter (or epicenter, depending on the GMPE) rather than the actual rupture
plane (or its surface projection), and for a large fault, these distances can be quite
different. For a non-point source, in fact, the hypocentral distance
can equal the closest distance, but it can also be significantly greater than the
closest distance.</p>
<p>ShakeMap addresses this issue by introducing the concept of median distance. Following
a study by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#epri2003"><span>EPRI (2003)</span></a>, we assume that an unknown fault of appropriate size could have
any orientation, and we derive the distance that produces the median ground motions of
all the possible fault orientations that pass through the hypocenter. (Thus, the term
&#8220;median distance&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer; it is more literally &#8220;distance of median ground
motion.&#8221;) Thus, for each point for which we want ground motion estimates, we compute
this distance and use it as input to the GMPE. We also adjust the uncertainty of the
estimate to account for the larger uncertainty associated with this situation. This feature
automatically applies for earthquake magnitudes &gt;= 5, but may be disabled with the <em>grind</em> flag
<em>-nomedian</em>.</p>
<p>Ideally, GMPE developers would always regress not only for fault distance, but also for
hypocentral distance. If this were done routinely, we would be able to initially use
the hypocentral-distance regression coefficients and switch to fault-distance terms as the
fault geometry was established. The median-distance approximation described above
could then be discarded.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="references.html#bommer2012"><span>Bommer and Akkar (2012)</span></a> have made the case for deriving both sets of coefficients:
&#8220;The most simple, consistent, efficient and elegant solution to this problem is for all
ground-motion prediction equations to be derived and presented in pairs of models, one
using the analysts&#8217; preferred extended source metric ... &#8212;and another using a point-
source metric, for which our preference would be hypocentral distance,
Rhyp&#8221;. Indeed, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#akkar2014"><span>Akkar et al. (2014)</span></a> provide such multiple coefficients
for their GMPEs for the Middle East and Europe. However, despite its utility, this
strategy has not been widely adopted among the requirements for modern GMPEs (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#powers2008"><span>Powers et al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#abrahamson2008"><span>Abrahamson et al., 2008</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#abrahamson2014"><span>2014</span></a>).</p>
<p>The hypocentral- or median-distance correction is not a trivial consideration. Note that for
Northridge, even when the fault is unknown and there are no data, the median-distance
correction (<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  8</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  9</a>, panels B and C) brings the shaking estimates more in line
with those constrained by knowledge of the fault. As mentioned earlier, the shaking for
this event exhibits a positive inter-event bias term, so even with the fault location
constrained, estimates still tend to under-predict the actual recordings, on average.</p>
<p>While the effect of this correction for the Northridge earthquake example is noticeable,
for events with larger finite faults, the median-distance correction becomes crucial while
awaiting constraints on rupture geometry from finite-fault modeling, aftershocks, and surface slip.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fault-dimensions">
<span id="sec-fault-dimensions"></span><h4>Fault Dimensions<a class="headerlink" href="#fault-dimensions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a> describes the format for specifying a
fault. Essentially, ShakeMap
faults are one or more (connected or disconnected) planar quadrilaterals. The fault
geometry is used by ShakeMap to compute distance-to-source for the GMPE, IPE, and
GMICE as well as to visualize the fault geometry in map view (for example, see red-line
rectangles in <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-7">Figure  8</a> and <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-8">Figure  9</a>). This distance is either to the surface projection of the
fault (for the so-called Joyner-Boore, or JB, distance), or to the rupture plane, depending on the
requirements of the prediction equation. In this case, the dimensions of the Northridge
rupture are constrained from analyses of the earthquake source (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1996"><span>Wald et al., 1996</span></a>).</p>
<p>While a finite fault is important for estimating the shaking from larger earthquakes, it is
typically not necessary to develop an extremely precise fault model, or to know the
rupture history. One or two fault planes usually suffice, except for very large or complex
surface-rupturing faults. In the immediate aftermath of a large earthquake, a first-order
fault model based on tectonic environment, known faults, aftershock distribution, and
empirical estimates based on the magnitude (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wells1994"><span>Wells and Coppersmith, 1994</span></a>) is often
sufficient to greatly improve the ShakeMap estimates in poorly instrumented areas. In
many cases, this amounts to an &#8220;educated guess”, and seismological expertise and
intuition are extremely helpful. Later refinements to the faulting geometry may or may
not fundamentally change the shaking pattern, depending on the density of near-source
observations. As we show in a later section, dense observations greatly diminish the
influence of the estimated ground motion at each grid point, obviating the need for precise
fault geometries in such estimates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directivity">
<span id="sec-directivity"></span><h4>Directivity<a class="headerlink" href="#directivity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Another way in which a finite fault may affect the estimated ground motions is through
directivity. Where a finite fault has been defined in ShakeMap, one may choose to apply
a correction for rupture directivity. We use the approach developed by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a>
for the NGA GMPEs (note: caution should be exercised when applying this directivity
function to non-NGA GMPEs). For the purposes of this calculation, we assume a
constant rupture over the fault surface. While the directivity effect is secondary to fault
geometry, it can make a not-insignificant difference in the near-source ground motions
up-rupture or along-strike from the hypocenter.</p>
<p>An example of the effect of the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> directivity term is shown clearly in
<a class="pageref" href="#figure1-13">Figure  14</a> for a hypothetical strike-slip faulting scenario along the Hayward Fault in the East Bay
area of San Francisco. Unilateral rupture southeastward results in stronger shaking,
particularly along the southern edge of the rupture. The frequency dependence of the
directivity terms provided by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#rowshandel2010"><span>Rowshandel (2010)</span></a> can be examined in detail by viewing
the intermediate grids produced and stored in the ShakeMap output
directory. In general, longer-period IMs (PGV, PSA1.0 and PSA3.0,
and MMI) are more strongly affected by the directivity function
employed.</p>

<h3>Additional Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a great number of details and options when running <em>grind</em>. Operators should
familiarize themselves with <em>grind</em>’s behavior by reading the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a>,
the configuration file (<em>grind.conf</em>), and the program&#8217;s
self-documentation (run “<em>grind -help</em>”).
Below are a few other characteristics of <em>grind</em> that the operator should be familiar with.</p>
<div class="section" id="user-supplied-estimate-grids">
<h4>User-supplied Estimate Grids<a class="headerlink" href="#user-supplied-estimate-grids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Much of the discussion above was centered on the use of GMPEs (and IPEs) and getting
the best set of estimates from them (through bias, basin corrections, finite faults, and directivity).
But the users may also supply their own grids of estimates for any or all of the ground motion
parameters. ShakeMap is indifferent as to the way these estimates are generated, as long
as they appear in a GMT grid in the event&#8217;s input directory, they will be used in place of
the GMPE&#8217;s estimates. (See the <a class="reference external" href="_static/SoftwareGuideV3_5.pdf">Software Guide</a> for the
specifications of these input
files.) If available, the user should also supply grids of uncertainties for the corresponding
parameters&#8212;if not, ShakeMap will use the uncertainties produced by
the GMPE.</p>
<p>User-supplied input motions allow the user to employ more sophisticated numerical ground-motion
modeling techniques, ones that may include, for example, fault-slip distribution and 3D propagation
effects not achievable using empirical GMPEs. The PGM
output grid of such calculations can be rendered with ShakeMap, allowing users to
visualize and employ familiar ShakeMap products. For instance, see the
ShakeCast scenario described in <a class="reference internal" href="shakemap_applications.html#sec-shakemap-applications"><span>Applications of ShakeMap</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uncertainty">
<h4>Uncertainty<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, some of the products of <em>grind</em> are grids of uncertainty for each
parameter. This uncertainty is the result of a weighted average combination of the
uncertainties of the various inputs (observations, converted observations, and estimates)
at each point in the output. These gridded uncertainties are provided in the file
<em>uncertainty.xml</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="products.html#sec-interpolated-grid-file"><span>Interpolated Ground Motion Grids</span></a> for a description of the

<p>Because we also know the GMPE uncertainty over the grid, we can compute the ratio of
the total ShakeMap uncertainty to the GMPE uncertainty. For the purposes of computing
this uncertainty ratio, we use PGA as the reference IM.</p>
<p>Continuing with the Northridge earthquake ShakeMap example, <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-12">Figure  15</a> presents the

</div>
<p>For a purely predictive map (of small magnitude), the uncertainty ratio will be 1.0
everywhere. For larger magnitude events, when a finite fault is not available, the
ShakeMap uncertainty is greater than the nominal GMPE uncertainty (as discussed above
in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-median-distance"><span>Median Distance and Finite Faults</span></a>), leading to a ratio greater than 1.0 in
the near-fault areas and diminishing with distance. When a finite fault is available, the
ratio returns to 1.0. In areas where data are available, the ShakeMap uncertainty is less
than that of the GMPE (see the section &#8220;Interpolation,&#8221; above), resulting in a ratio less
than 1.0. A grid of the uncertainty ratio (and the PGA uncertainty) is provided in the
output file <em>grid.xml</em> (see <a class="reference internal" href="products.html#sec-interpolated-grid-file"><span>Interpolated Ground Motion Grids</span></a> for a description of

several earthquakes that were both very well surveyed for MMI, and also well
instrumented for recorded ground motions. By relating the ground motions to MMI, Wald

motions. These “instrumental intensities” could be interpolated over an area and

more comprehensive descriptions provided in the MMI (e.g.,
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey2000"><span>Dewey et al., 2000</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
or EMS-98 (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#grunthal1998"><span>Grunthal et al., 1998</span></a>) scales; however, they offer convenient description for
our purposes.</p>
<p>By relating recorded peak ground motions to Modified Mercalli Intensities, we can
generate instrumental intensities within a few minutes of an earthquake. In the current
ShakeMap system, these instrumental intensities can be combined with direct measures
of intensity (from “Did You Feel It?”, for example) and interpolated across the affected area. With the
color-coding and two-word text descriptors, we can adequately describe the associated
perceived shaking and potential damage consistent with both human response and
damage assessments of past earthquakes to characterize the shaking from just-occurred
earthquakes.</p>

<h3>Color Palette for the ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale<a class="headerlink" href="#color-palette-for-the-shakemap-instrumental-intensity-scale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The color coding for the Instrumental Intensity map uses a standard rainbow palette (see Table
1.1).  The &#8220;cool&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221; color scheme is familiar to most and is readily recognizable,
as it is used as a standard in many fields (for example, see USA Today&#8217;s daily temperature
maps of the U.S.).  Note that we do not believe intensity II and III can be consistently
distinguished from ground-motions alone, so they are grouped together, see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  16</a>. In
addition, we saturate intensity X+ with dark red; observed ground motions alone are not
sufficient to warrant any higher intensities, given that the available empirical relationships
do not have any values of intensity greater than IX. In recent years, the USGS has limited
observed MMIs to IX, reserving intensity X for possible future
observations (see <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>, for more details); the USGS no
longer assigns intensity XI and XII. We note that there were only
only two intensity-IX assignments for the 1994 Northridge earthquake (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
and only two or three proper intensity-IX assignments for the
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (J. Dewey, 2015, personal communication).</p>

<h3>ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Text Descriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-instrumental-intensity-scale-text-descriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The estimated intensity map is usually wholly or partially derived from ground motions
recorded by seismic instruments, and represents intensities that are likely to have been
associated with the recorded ground motions. However, unlike conventional intensities,
the instrumental intensities are not based on observations of the earthquake’s effects on
people or structures. The terms &#8220;perceived shaking&#8221; and &#8220;potential damage&#8221; in the
ShakeMap legend are chosen for this reason; these intensities were not observed, but they
are consistent on average with intensities at these ranges of ground motions recorded in a
number of past earthquakes (see, for example, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wald1999b"><span>Wald et al., 1999b</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden et al., 2012</span></a>).
Two-word descriptions of both shaking and damage levels are provided to summarize the
effects in an area; they were derived with careful consideration of the existing
descriptions in the Modified Mercalli definitions (L. Dengler and J. Dewey, written
communication, 1998, 2003).</p>
<p>The ShakeMap qualitative descriptions of shaking are intended to be consistent with the way
people perceive the shaking in earthquakes.  The descriptions for intensities up to VII are
constrained by the work of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dengler1998"><span>Dengler and Dewey (1998)</span></a>, in which they compared results of
telephone surveys with USGS MMI intensities for the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The
ShakeMap descriptions up to intensity VII may be viewed as a rendering of Dengler and
Dewey&#8217;s Figure 7a.</p>
<p>The instrumental intensity map for the Northridge earthquake shares most of the notable
features of the Modified Mercalli map prepared by the USGS (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dewey1995"><span>Dewey et al., 1995</span></a>),
including the relatively high intensities near Santa Monica and southeast of the epicenter
near Sherman Oaks.  However, in general, the area of intensity IX on the instrumentally
derived intensity map is slightly larger than on the USGS Modified Mercalli intensity
map. This reflects the fact that although much of the Santa Susanna mountains, north and
northwest of the epicenter, were very strongly shaken, the region is also sparsely
populated, hence, observed intensities could not be determined there.  This is a fundamental
difference between observed and instrumentally derived intensities: instrumental
intensities will show high levels of strong shaking independent of the exposure of
populations and buildings, while observed intensities only represent intensities where there are
structures to damage and people to experience the earthquake.</p>
<p>The ShakeMap descriptions of felt shaking begin to lose meaning above intensity VII or VIII. In
the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#dengler1998"><span>Dengler and Dewey (1998)</span></a> study, peoples&#8217; perception of shaking began to saturate in
the VII-VIII range, with more than half the people at VII-VIII and above
reporting the shaking as &#8220;violent&#8221; (on a scale from &#8220;weak&#8221; to &#8220;violent”).  In the ShakeMap
descriptions, we intensified the descriptions of shaking with increases of intensity above
VII, because the evidence from instrumental data is that the shaking is stronger.  But we
know of no solid evidence that one could discriminate intensities higher than VII on the
basis of different individuals&#8217; descriptions of perceived shaking alone.</p>
<p>ShakeMap is not unique in describing intensity VI as corresponding to strong shaking. In
the 7-point Japanese macroseismic scale, for which intensity 4 is equivalent to MMI VI,
intensity 4 is described as &#8220;strong.&#8221; In the European Macroseismic Scale (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#grunthal1998"><span>Grunthel et al.,
1998</span></a>) (EMS-98), which is compatible with MMI (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#musson2010"><span>Musson et al., 2010</span></a>), the bullet description of intensity
V is  &#8220;strong.&#8221;  Higher EMS-98 intensities are given bullet descriptions in terms of the
damage they produce, rather than the strength of perceived shaking.</p>

<h3>ShakeMap Intensity Scale and Peak Ground Motions<a class="headerlink" href="#shakemap-intensity-scale-and-peak-ground-motions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ShakeMap Instrumental Intensity Scale Legend provides the PGA and PGV
associated with the central value in each
intensity box (see <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  16</a>). For all current GMICEs, the ground motion scale is
logarithmic, with an increase of one intensity unit resulting from approximately a
doubling of peak ground motion. Nevertheless, each GMICE has its own mapping of
ground motion to intensity, and thus the values shown in the scale legend can vary,
depending on the GMICE chosen for the map in question. To avoid confusion, the
legends now have a citation in the lower left specifying which GMICE was used to
produce the map and scale. Note, however, that while the mapping of ground motion to
intensity varies, the mapping of color to intensity remains the same for all maps.</p>
<p>We note that the ShakeMap legends (e.g., <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-16">Figure  16</a>) have evolved slightly from the
earlier version of ShakeMap and the 2005 ShakeMap Manual. The PGMs tabulated are
no longer provided by (previously redundant) PGM ranges, but rather by the median
motions associated with the intensity on the scale.</p>

<h3>Color Coding Stations by Intensity<a class="headerlink" href="#color-coding-stations-by-intensity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, stations on the PGM ShakeMaps were color-coded to the seismic network
that provided them. More recent versions of ShakeMap, however, allow the operator to
color the stations with the intensity they produced, with each PGM parameter (e.g., PGA,
PGV, PSA03) using its own intensity correlation. <a class="pageref" href="#figure1-11">Figure  17</a> (and
many of the other figures throughout this guide) illustrates the color coding of stations
by their intensity values for several parameters. The operator can elect this option by

<span id="peak-values-vs-mean"></span><h3>Use of Peak Values Rather than Mean<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-peak-values-rather-than-mean" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With ShakeMap, we chose to represent peak ground motions as recorded. We depict the
larger of the two horizontal components, rather than as either a vector sum, or as a
geometric mean value. The initial choice of peak values was necessitated by the fact that
roughly two-thirds of the TriNet (now the Southern California portion of CISN) strong-
motion data (the California Geological Survey, or CGS, data)
are delivered as peak values for individual components of
motion, that is, as parametric data rather than waveforms. This left two options: providing peak
values or median of the peak values&#8212;determining vector sums of the two horizontal
components was not an option, because the peak values on each component do not
necessarily occur at the same time.  A useful strategy going forward may be to employ
the 50th percentile of the response spectra over all non-redundant rotation angles
(RotD050; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#boore2010"><span>Boore et al., 2010</span></a>), which is becoming a standard
for &#8220;next-generation&#8221;
GMPEs (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#abrahamson2014"><span>Abrahamson et al., 2014</span></a>), or on another
agreed-upon vector-component
calculation. (See <a class="reference internal" href="future_directions.html#future-directions"><span>Future Directions</span></a>). However, such changes would
require adoption of these
calculations on the part of each contributing seismic network, and would thus require
consensus (and substantial software upgrades) all around.</p>
<p>Despite the common use of mean values in attenuation relations and loss estimation, we
decided that computing and depicting median values, which effectively reduces
information and discards the largest values of shaking, was not acceptable. This is
particularly true for highly directional near-fault pulse-like ground motions, for which
peak velocities can be large on one component and small on the other.  Mean values for
such motions (particularly when determined in logarithmic space) can seriously underrepresent
the largest motion that a building may have experienced, and these pulse-like motions are
typically associated with the regions of greatest damage. Thus, we chose peak ground
motions as the parameters to be mapped.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="references.html#beyer2006"><span>Beyer and Bommer (2006)</span></a> provide statistical relationships
to convert among median and
peak parameters and between aleatory variability for different definitions of the
horizontal component of motion. This is useful when approximating alternative
components than those presented, but one must recognize that for any individual record,
these statistics may or may not be representative.</p>
<p>Initially, our use of PGA and PGV for estimating intensities was also simply practical.
We were retrieving only peak values from a large subset of the network, so it was
impractical to compute more specific ground-motion parameters, such as average-
response spectral values, kinetic energy, cumulative absolute velocities (CAV, <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#epri1991"><span>EPRI,
1991</span></a>), or the JMA intensity algorithm (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#jma1996"><span>JMA, 1996</span></a>). However, because
near-source strong ground motions are often dominated by short-duration, pulse-like
ground motions (usually associated with source directivity), PGV appears to be a robust measure
of intensity for strong shaking. In other words, the kinetic energy (proportional to
velocity squared) available for damage is well characterized by PGV. In addition, the
close correspondence of the JMA intensities and peak ground velocity
indicates that our use of peak ground velocities for higher intensities was
consistent with the algorithm used by JMA. Work by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#wu2003"><span>Wu et al. (2003)</span></a> indicates a very
good correspondence between PGV and damage for data collected on the island of Taiwan,
which included high-quality loss data and densely sampled strong-motion observations
for the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake. More recent work on Ground-Motion/Intensity
Conversion Equations (GMICEs) (e.g., <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#atkinson2007"><span>Atkinson and Kaka, 2007</span></a>; <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#worden2012"><span>Worden, et al., 2012</span></a>) has also
confirmed the strong relationship between PGV and intensity.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, for large, distant earthquakes, peak motions may be less informative, and
spectral content and perhaps duration become key parameters.  Although we may eventually
adopt corrections for these situations, it is difficult to assign intensities in such cases. For
instance, it is difficult to assign the intensity in the zone of Mexico City where numerous
high-rises collapsed during the 1985 Michoacan earthquake. There was obviously high-
intensity shaking for high-rise buildings; however, most smaller buildings were
unaffected, suggesting a much lower intensity.  Whereas PGVs were
moderate and would imply intensity VIII, resonance and duration conspired to cause a
more substantial damage than peak values would indicate. Although this is, in part, a
shortcoming of using peak parameters alone, it is more a limitation imposed by
simplifying the complexity of ground motions into a single parameter. Therefore, in
addition to providing peak ground-motion values and intensity, we are also producing
spectral response maps (for 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 sec). Users who can process this information
for loss estimation will have a clearer picture than can be provided with maps of PGA
and PGV alone. However, as discussed earlier, a simple intensity map is extremely useful
for the overwhelming majority of users, which includes the general public and many
people involved with the initial emergency response.</p>
